### Welcome to the .NET **nanoFramework** metadata processor repository

This repo contains .NET **nanoFramework** metadata processor tool.
It's a console app that performs various tasks when running a build of a C# project, like parsing the PE file generated by Roslyn, generating the PDBX files, generate the stubs for native code.
Is part of .NET **nanoFramework** toolbox, along with other various tools that are required in .NET **nanoFramework** development, usage or repository management.

Version 2.0 is a C# application adapted from the original work of [Oleg Rakhmatulin](@OlegRa).
Version 1.0 was a Visual C++ application adapted from .NETMF toolbox.

## Developers guide

### Cloning the repository

After cloning the repository, instantiate the submodules with:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

After which the NuGet packages in both the main solution and the mscorelib solution included within a submodule have to be restored. These have to be restored individually.

### Adding projects to the solution

When adding a project to the solution the following points have to be kept in mind for configuring the project and solution:

- nanoFramework projects (.nfproj) have to be build in `AnyCPU` configuration.
- DLLs for msbuild tasks have to be build in `x64` because Visual Studio uses this architecture since VS2022.
- Any nanoFramework projects (.nfproj) that are required for Unit Tests have to have theyr build configuration changed so they don't build. Building those has to be added to the pre-build event of the Unit Test project that will be using it. See the [prebuild event](https://github.com/KasperJSdeVries/metadata-processor/blob/ad91245f85dee8683670ef81c3f1f9556ecb2ac0/MetadataProcessor.Tests/MetadataProcessor.Tests.csproj#L118) for the MetadataProcessor.Tests project.
